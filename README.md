# Owls Discord

## Installation

Just like our other projects so far, install locally with ```pip install -e .```. If you can't do this, you can still navivate locally and run ```python server.py``` within the owls discord directory.

## Running

If you installed with pip you can run ```owls_discord_server YOURTOKEN```, otherwise run ```python owls_dsicord/server.py YOURTOKEN``` 

## How you get a token

To get a token, you have to login to discord and create an app, click create token, and then install your app in the right place. On top of that you need to set various permissions. I can help with that, or you can look it up.

## What to add

Right now if you look at the code the bot responds to messages that just say "owls" with "hello world."

Some ideas for stuff to add:

1. Reach out to a website for info. Go get the current weather or something.
2. Dice roller. (someone says roll a dice, you emit a random number).
3. Look up further bot capabilities, add audio, add images.
4. Some sort of game.
